Description
-----------

seeULater is a book mark manager. You can add, delete, edit, add memos and share URLs you interested!
Inspired by the lack of good book mark manager with having remote stores, now we can store and manage favorite pages easily. This project uses a remote repository(AWS ec2 and RDS), so you can access your bookmark with your account from anywhere.

* Add interesting pages URL
* View your favorites
* Delete contents in your list
* Create folders, and add contents to folder
